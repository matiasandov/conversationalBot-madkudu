The Marketer’s Dilemma
The Madkudu Way
Why is this relevant?
This article is intended to be used by the marketer who wants to see the quality of their inbound leads by channel and by campaign.  (Report implementation instructions are available to download, see link at bottom of this article).
The Marketer’s Dilemma
Potentially Burning Marketing Budget
“I spend on an acquisition channel, but it takes the length of the sales cycle to see if the channel is valuable enough to keep investing in.”
  The Madkudu Way
Smart Insights, Less Waiting, Accurate Decisions
“Accurately assess the performance of acquisition channels quickly”
    Why is this relevant?
Use your MadKudu Customer Fit score to assess the quality of leads per channel and adjust spend accordingly
Your Madkudu customer fit score is an indicator of your expected pipeline. Use it to determine the quality per channel and optimize your marketing spend per channel.
Generating high quality leads that aren’t converting?  Use this as an input to nurture your campaigns and walk those valuable leads further down the funnel.
Bet big on the channels that drive quality leads, stop wasting money on channels that don’t.
  Assessing Response Quality By Channel
Discriminate between channels generating mostly low (Free Rates) vs mostly high (Whitepaper) quality leads.
Compare volumes and cost of acquisition to determine whether it makes sense to move your marketing budget from one channel to another. If the cost of acquisition for a quality lead from Free Rates happens to be 10X less that the cost of acquisition for Whitepaper - then it would make sense to generate those Free Rate quality leads, and nurture them.
   Response Quality By Channel Over Time
As Marketers, we want to understand if the quality of leads per channel evolves over time.  In this example, we see that the volume of quality leads maintains, and even increases slightly.
Therefore we would expect to see performance increase marginally (increase of leads to closed won by this channel).  If we allocate additional budget spend to this channel, we would also want to see an increase in the lead to deal ratio. 
  In this next example, we see that the volume of quality leads drastically decreases.
However, the revenue generated by the channel may still remain consistent, if the number of quality leads is maintained.  If we spend more on this channel, and there is no increase in quality leads which convert to deals, we will reduce the ROI for this channel, despite the revenue remaining the same.

Can I rename the standard MadKudu attributes?
Can I add aggregated behavioral attributes?
Can the MadKudu team help with adding these Salesforce fields?
Where do I set up the mapping of MadKudu Intelligence to my Salesforce fields?
We push several fields to your CRM, let's summarize what they are.
How do I see MadKudu Intelligence?
If you are on a Pro Plan, you have 3 Lead/Contact level models (more details about the models here). 
the Customer Fit model
the Likelihood to Buy model
the Lead Grade
If you are on a Growth Plan, you will have one model, the Customer Fit model at the Lead/Contact level.
You may also upgrade your subscription with Account level scoring (for Salesforce only)
The Account Fit (Customer Fit)
The Account Engagement (Likelihood to Buy) + Most Likely Persona
  For each model, we push 3-4 fields to your CRM: 
a segment
a score: integer from 0 to 100 in case you need more granularity than the segment
some emojis (nicer than words to display to your SDRs - Salesforce only)
some signals : these are a list of positive and negative reasons that explain why the lead has been scored this way. These reasons are not exclusive but they give the Sales team some visibility and context.
What are the names of these fields?
To find the exact standard name in each system, please refer to this documentation.
What's the link between the segments and the scores? 
Customer Fit model 
⭐️⭐️⭐️  Very good segment: scores from 85 to 100
⭐️⭐️      Good segment: scores from 70 to 84
⭐️          Medium segment: scores from 50 to 69
❌          Low segment: scores from 0 to 49
Likelihood to Buy model 
🔥🔥🔥  Very high segment: scores from 85 to 100
🔥🔥      High segment: scores from 70 to 84
🔥          Medium segment: scores from 50 to 69
❄️          Low segment: scores from 0 to 49
Lead Grade
A: scores from 90 to 100
B: scores from 75 to 89
C: scores from 50 to 74
D: scores from 25 to 49
E: scores from 1 to 24
What does it look like in my CRM?
Here is an example of what the fields can look like in Salesforce.
What are the MadKudu field type requirements?
For exact specifications of the fields to create, please refer to these field specifications.
Do I have to display all these fields?
You can decide which fields you would like to display for your CRM users, based on the level of information you want to provide and the usage you make of the models.
Very often, customers use the Customer Fit model to make a first filter and then the Lead Grade to prioritize, among the qualified leads, the ones that are the most engaged.
Can I rename the standard MadKudu attributes?
This is possible only if you are on the Enterprise plan. We strongly recommend the use of the “mk_ prefix” naming convention. It allows you to always know which fields are populated by MadKudu and which are not.
Can I add aggregated behavioral attributes?
Yes, this is possible if you are on the Enterprise plan. MadKudu syncs a wide variety of attributes into your CRM. For example, you can create a “number of users invited” aggregation that calculates how many users were invited. This aggregation is then synced to your salesforce lead profile.
Can the MadKudu team help with adding these Salesforce fields?
Yes - this is a key step in your onboarding and will be discussed with your Customer Success team.
Where do I set up the mapping of MadKudu Intelligence to my Salesforce fields?
You can do this in MadKudu's App, under Settings > Push

Enrichment

Definition
Use cases
What enrichment providers do MadKudu work with? 
F.A.Q
Does MadKudu resell data?
Definition
Enrichment on MadKudu platform includes firmographic, demographic and technographic data coming from
first-party data from your internal systems (CRM, Marketing Automation...)
e.g. team size you collect on the sign up form, company size your sales team adjusts after getting on a call with the prospect
third-party data from vendors you contract directly with
MadKudu gets this data through the systems you integrated with our platform.
e.g. ZoomInfo, FunnelBeam, Clearbit, Intricately ...
third-party data from vendors MadKudu partners with to use to provide scoring or segmentation to our customers.
MadKudu partners with Clearbit, HG data and PredictLeads in addition to creating custom enrichment (spam detector, predicted revenue or predicted traffic ...)
It transforms each new email or domain into a complete person or company profile, enriching your customer understanding, and giving your team the context necessary to take action.
First-party data that is qualified to be used in your customer fit model(s) is demographic, firmographic, or technographic data that is stable in time, especially through the opportunity funnel. You only want to use fields that are populated at the creation of the lead/contact. Don’t use fields that are filled in (manually or automatically) as the opportunity moves through the funnel, since that will introduce a major bias in the model(s). MadKudu typically recommends to use enrichment such as country, industry, company size, title, if you have that.
Use cases
Enrichment can be used to
determine if a Person or Company is a good fit for you through the Customer Fit scoring. Learn more.
segment your leads or accounts with a computation directly exported to your CRM
e.g. you would like to identify if an account in using a competitor solution. With MadKudu you can build a computation based on technographic data like: "is_using_competitor" which parses the techs a company is using Learn more
What enrichment providers do MadKudu work with? 
MadKudu partners with the following leaders in demographics, firmographics and technographics data
Clearbit: turns email addresses and domain names into full prospect and company profiles with more than 85 demographic, firmographic and technographic data points.  Learn more.
HG Insights (formerly HG Data): global leader in technology intelligence, providing behind the firewall Technology Install Data to help you segment your prospect based on their company tech stack. Learn more
PredictLeads: provides Hiring data to help you identify which companies are growing and hiring in the role fit for your product.  Learn more. 
MadKudu gets fresh data from these providers on a monthly basis.
F.A.Q
Does MadKudu resell data?
No, MadKudu partners with data vendors to use in segmentation and predictions but does not resell or sync raw data directly to your CRM. Only predictions and segmentations built on top of this data can be pushed directly to your CRM.

Video tutorials are only available to users logged in to the MadKudu help center. Click here to learn how to create an account in the MadKudu help center. 
Overview
Prediction models in Madkudu can help route and prioritize either people (leads & contacts) or companies (accounts).
MadKudu offers 2 main categories of prediction models: 
the Customer Fit model
helps answer "who is this person?", "is the company they work for a good fit?"
the Likelihood to Buy model (Behavioral)
helps answers "how are they using our product?", "what actions are most correlated to conversion?", "is now a good time to reach out?"
The third category of prediction models, the Lead Grade, is simply a combination of the two others.
The Customer Fit model (demographic)
Uses firmographic and demographic data — which allows you to check whether or not a lead or account matches your ideal customer profile (Who is this lead? Does this lead look qualified?). Because the model uses firmographic and demographic data as input, the scores will not change much over time. 
The Likelihood to buy model (behavioral)
Utilizes your behavioral data (in-app usage, website activity, marketing campaigns, etc.) to measure engagement of the lead or account (What has this lead been doing recently? Has the lead tried to engage with you?). Because the input of the model uses behavioral data, the scores are recomputed several times throughout the day. The behavioral score is all about timing.
The Lead Grade
Combines both Customer Fit and the Behavioral components. It enables you to identify the leads that are the most qualified and the most engaged. Because the Lead Grade has a behavioral component, it is also recomputed several times a day. Learn more about lead grades here.
Note: MadKudu does not support nor offer an "Account Grade"

Batch versus Real time scoring in your integrations

Supported Destinations
What models for what type of scoring?
When does MadKudu update records? 
Rate Limiting
Retries
F.A.Q
I have a lot of volume, what can we do about it?
Why aren't all of my leads synced to my integrations?
What if I need to upload a large list?
MadKudu can send scores to your integrations of choice. We integrate with half a dozen of integrations in which we’ll send predictions and segmentation to your Contacts or Accounts profiles. Learn more about our integrations.
We push scores in two different ways:
Real-Time: records are scored within 5-15 minutes of their creation in your CRM.
Batch: a record's score is updated every 4-12 hours (time is dependent on the amount of data) with any new information or activity. 
  Supported Destinations
Destination Object Realtime (Fit model) Batch
Salesforce Lead, Contact, Account ✅(not for accounts) ✅
HubSpot Contact ✅ ✅
Marketo Contact ✅ ✅
Eloqua Contact ✅ ✅
Segment Identify ❌ ✅
Intercom Lead, User ✅ ❌
Amazon S3 Contact ❌ ✅
To begin sending scores to a new destination, connect your system to MadKudu in app.madkudu.com > Integrations and reach out to your customer success manager so that we can enable the right sync configuration on our end for you.
  What models for what type of scoring?
The Customer Fit scores can be pushed both in real-time and batch scoring at the Lead and Contact level
The Likelihood to Buy scores are only available in batch scoring, since it takes some time to collect activity data before making predictions 
The scoring of Salesforce Accounts is only available in batch scoring for Fit or Likelihood to Buy score 
When does MadKudu update records? 
In Salesforce for example: 
Few minutes after the creation of a Lead/Contact in Salesforce, MadKudu will update the mk_customer_fit_* fields. This is the "realtime scoring" of the Customer Fit model. 
Every 4-12h, MadKudu will update all the mk_* fields of Lead/Contact and Account if there is any update to push. This is the "batch scoring" for all the models. 
the MK Customer Fit fields will rarely change over time unless there is a model update 
the MK Likelihood to Buy and MK Lead Grade fields will likely change every day, as these fields contain the behavioral score, and some leads, contacts, and accounts have daily activity. Additionally, in the absence of activity, the score decreases over time on a daily basis. 
This schedule is not fixed, this is a continuous process (Learn more here) 
When a new version of a model is deployed from the Data Studio by your admin (or by our team upon request), expect more records to be updated especially if a new Customer Fit model is deployed. When a model is deployed, the updates will occur in batch scoring at the next sync process. 
Rate Limiting
Realtime scoring (MadKudu API rate limit)
If we pull from your integrations more than 500 new records to score within a 5 minute period, MadKudu real-time scoring will queue any additional events and process those at a slower rate.
Batch scoring (Destination rate limit)
To guarantee the performance of their system, destination integrations (e.g. Salesforce, Marketo, Hubspot, Segment, ...) limit the number of API calls that they can process in a given timeframe. This is called rate limiting, which cannot be controlled by MadKudu 
The consequence of that is that the sync of large volumes of data cannot be instantaneous. For example, if you load a list of 100,000 leads in one go in your CRM, this will impact how fast leads can be scored by MadKudu in your CRM.
Here are the rate limits of some of our integrations:
Retries
When the push of scores in batch to a destination fails (because of the integration rate-limiting described above or any other reason outside of MadKudu's control) MadKudu will attempt 9 more times to score the record within the following 2 hours. 
  F.A.Q
I have a lot of volume, what can we do about it?
It can become challenging to sync over 100k+ daily active users (DAU) with a CRM like Salesforce. That’s because:
With Likelihood to Buy, we need to update scores as regularly as possible to make sure they’re up-to-date for your team to reach out to "ready to buy" prospects.
We may hit daily rate limits from Salesforce (which results in delays in syncing).
We’ve worked before with huge volumes of data so we’ll make sure to prepare a plan on how we can work with your current volume.
Why aren't all of my leads synced to my integrations?
Several things could be happening:
We’ve been hitting API Quotas (see above for rate limiting) so we’re delaying the update.
We apply filters on which leads are being sent to your integrations.
On this last point, please reach out to your account manager and we’ll go through these filters together to make sure that they fit your needs.
What if I need to upload a large list?
Want to upload a large list of records to your CRM?
You can either get the scores
before uploading the list to your CRM using the MadKudu Bulk Scorer on a CSV file (only for customer fit score). 
after uploading the list to your CRM and the sync process will start scoring the new records as described above in this article.
The time it takes to score the list of records depends on the number of records in it.
