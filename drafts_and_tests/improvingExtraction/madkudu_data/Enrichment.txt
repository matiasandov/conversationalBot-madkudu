Definition
Enrichment on MadKudu platform includes firmographic, demographic and technographic data coming from
first-party data from your internal systems (CRM, Marketing Automation...)
e.g. team size you collect on the sign up form, company size your sales team adjusts after getting on a call with the prospect
third-party data from vendors you contract directly with
MadKudu gets this data through the systems you integrated with our platform.
e.g. ZoomInfo, FunnelBeam, Clearbit, Intricately ...
third-party data from vendors MadKudu partners with to use to provide scoring or segmentation to our customers.
MadKudu partners with Clearbit, HG data and PredictLeads in addition to creating custom enrichment (spam detector, predicted revenue or predicted traffic ...)
It transforms each new email or domain into a complete person or company profile, enriching your customer understanding, and giving your team the context necessary to take action.
First-party data that is qualified to be used in your customer fit model(s) is demographic, firmographic, or technographic data that is stable in time, especially through the opportunity funnel. You only want to use fields that are populated at the creation of the lead/contact. Donâ€™t use fields that are filled in (manually or automatically) as the opportunity moves through the funnel, since that will introduce a major bias in the model(s). MadKudu typically recommends to use enrichment such as country, industry, company size, title, if you have that.
