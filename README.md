# Madkudu Conversational Agent

Dear Machine Learning team and recruiters at Madkudu,

Welcome to my Conversational Agent project for Madkudu.

The distribution of my repository is divided in 2:

1. `solution`: In this directory you will find attached the final files with the solution to my project. Which are the followings:
   
  - 1.1 `madkudu_assistant_agent.py`: This is the most important file since it contains the Conversational Agent application.
    -  1.1.1 To run this file remember to be in the  `solution` directory
    -  1.1.2 Note that it is important to have accesss to a valid key of OpenAi, in this case I am leaving mine just for the team to test but after the review it will be deactivated.
      - In this case I am using a free credits that I have from OpenAi.
  
  - 1.2  `dataExtraction.ipynb`: This file is a web crawler I built to extract data from some sections of the support website of madkud. Since I have limited credits of OpenAi I used few urls.
  - 1.3 `all.txt`: Data extracted with the crawler
  - 1.4 `assistant_creation.ipynb`: A notebook I used to test, scale, and create the conversational chain step by step. It also needs an OpenAi key

2. `drafts_and_tests`: This directory contains different other solutions that I tried or that I can still use to scale this project. I attached this folder **just to show my creative process before achieving the final solution**.
